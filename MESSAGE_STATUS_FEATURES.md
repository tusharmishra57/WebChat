### **How It Works:**

#### **Sending Flow:**
1. User types message → Shows "Sending..." (⏳)
2. Message saved to DB → Status: "Sent" (✓)
3. Recipient online → Status: "Delivered" (✓✓)
4. Recipient views → Status: "Seen" (✓✓ colored)

#### **Receiving Flow:**
1. Message arrives → Display in chat
2. If user at bottom → Auto-mark as seen
3. If user scrolled up → Show "new messages" indicator
4. When user scrolls to view → Mark as seen
5. Notify sender about seen status

#### **Bulk Seen Marking:**
- When user opens chat → Mark all unread messages as seen
- When user scrolls to bottom → Mark visible messages as seen
- Real-time notifications to all senders

### **Visual Indicators:**

```
Your message [Sent]     ✓
Your message [Delivered] ✓✓  
Your message [Seen]     ✓✓ (colored)

Received message (no status shown)
```

### **Socket Events:**
- `message_sent` - Confirms message saved
- `message_delivered` - Confirms message delivered  
- `message_seen` - Single message marked as seen
- `mark_messages_seen` - Bulk mark as seen
- `messages_seen` - Notify sender about seen status

### **Testing Instructions:**

1. **Basic Status Test:**
   - Send message → Should show "Sent" (✓)
   - Recipient online → Should show "Delivered" (✓✓)
   - Recipient views → Should show "Seen" (✓✓ colored)

2. **Emotion/Mood Status Test:**
   - Send emotion → Status appears
   - Send mood image → Status appears
   - All message types show status

3. **Bulk Seen Test:**
   - Have multiple unread messages
   - Open chat → All should mark as seen
   - Sender should see status updates

4. **Scroll Detection Test:**
   - Scroll up in chat
   - Receive new message → Should NOT auto-mark as seen
   - Scroll down to view → Should mark as seen

5. **Mobile Test:**
   - Status icons visible on mobile
   - Proper responsive behavior
   - Touch scrolling works

### **Status Colors:**
- **Sent**: Gray (✓)
- **Delivered**: Blue (✓✓)  
- **Seen**: Green (✓✓) with double-check animation

## 🎯 **All Requirements Met:**

✅ **"On last message that I have sent, I should be able to see whether the message is sent or not"**
✅ **"After the message is sent I should be able to see whether the other user have seen this message or not"** 
✅ **"It should show me every time I send a message or mood or emotion"**

The message status system is now fully implemented and working for all message types!
